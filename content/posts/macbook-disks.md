Typically, to find the overall wear of a MacBook drive, one installs `smartctl` from [smartmontools](http://www.smartmontools.org/) via `brew install smartmontools` or `sudo port install smartmontools`

Then by looking at the `Percentage Used` from the output of `smartctl -a /dev/disk0`

Or as a one-liner

`smartctl -a /dev/disk0 | awk -F ':' '/Percentage Used:/{gsub(/ /, "", $2); print $2}'`

In my case it's `0%`, but what exactly does `Percentage Used` mean? These [Kingston](https://media.kingston.com/support/downloads/MKP_521.6_SMART-DCP1000_attribute.pdf) and [nvmexpress.com's](https://www.nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/NVM_Express_Management_Interface_1_0a_2017.04.08_-_gold.pdf) documents shed some light

My hunch is that it's probably related to `Data Units Read` and `Data Units Written` given how often MacOS swaps, but since the attribute is vendor specific it may be misinterpreted, I suppose time will tell whether these new soldered-on SSD MacBooks will become bricks.
